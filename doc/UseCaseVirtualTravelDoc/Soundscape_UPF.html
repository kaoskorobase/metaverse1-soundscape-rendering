  <h1>EXPERIENCE THE REAL GRAN CANARIA SOUNDSCAPE </h1>
  
  <p> The capabilities for creating in SecondLife are currently quite limited. Thus we
  recreated the real soundscape in Gran Canaria based
  on field-recordings and a generative soundscapes system developed at
  the Music Technology Group of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra,
  Barcelona. 
  
A proxy application (to be installed on your computer) intercept the traffic between the SecondLife server
  (sim) and the viewer in order to send status updates (such as avatar
  posoition, head rotation, time of day, etc.) to a custom soundscape
  streaming server with an HTTP API. A separate stream is generated for
  each client and received through the SecondLife viewer application
  via a local streaming proxy connection. This requires running a proxy
  program along with SecondLife.  
  </p>
  
  <p>  
  To experience the soundscape you need to: 
<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://mtg.upf.edu/technologies/soundscapes?p=Downloads"> download the Soundscape application</a> and follow the installation instructions. Check the Readme file for further information. </li>
<li> You will need the restart the SL-Viewer as specified in the Soundscape README.txt file.  </li>
<li> After restarting, in the SL-Viewer you need to configure the audio properties as follows:<br> 
<ul>
<li> 1)  (go to Me>Preferences>Sound and Media> menu </li><br> <li> 2) enable and unmute the Streaming music channels;</li> <br> <li> 3) Mute the sound effect and ambient channels </li><br>  </li>
</ul>
</ul>
